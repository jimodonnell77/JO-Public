The LD HW Notes - Jim O'Donnell.doc file contains the activities I completed per the SE_Candidate_HW_2.0.pdf.  
I also included screenshots to show the results I was getting in the UI and changes to the index.html files.
To run this demo make the appropriate changes called out in the index.html file
